        "The \"Spoiled Cat Problem\" is a complex challenge in data science, resembling an unpredictable, fickle cat. It involves sophisticated data cleaning and analysis, where datasets display confusing, nonlinear patterns. This long-standing scientific puzzle tests advanced data techniques and remains unsolved, symbolizing a quest for clarity in chaotic data.\n",

        "Well, it turns out that the \"Spoiled Cat Problem\" was actually a made up concept by your professor. It doesn't really exist. But, we might actually have a cat-related issue. The rumor has it, the only original copy of this dataset was left unattended while the person responsible for the the data collection stepped out for coffee. During this time, her mischievous cat, mistaking the computer mouse for a real one, ended up tampering with the dataset. If you don't believe me, you can consult your cat about such a scenario's likelihood! As a result, simple \"Yes\" responses may have turned into \"Yesssssss,\" and numerical entries could have been changed to negative or absurdly high values. So, as you work through the questions, please keep this peculiar situation in mind.\n",
